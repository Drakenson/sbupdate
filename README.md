Fork of Andrey Vihrovs awesome sbupdate tool, which disables the one core feature: to sign kernels for secure boot.
..yeah, I know.. Just for personal use, 'cause I like the feature to create on single file out of kernel, initramfs and microcodes.
Please do not use, if you want to sign your code, please use the original version at https://github.com/andreyv/sbupdate.
